# RedsysTPV 
 
### *Note: It fully supports Blazor webassembly and a sample application is provided in the repository.*

### ¡¡¡This project has been refactored by ProDInfo. Thanks for your support and your great research to update all numeric codes!!!

## SHA256 signature implementation

This is a .NET Standard library based on RedsysTPV by mbuenoferrer for help you on cart and orders integrations with the Redsys payment gateway (a platform that manage online payments for several spanish banks like La Caixa, Banco Santander, BBVA, Banco Sabadell, Bankia, etc). Now it can be used on .NET Core or any other that implements netstandard 2.0.

This library is released because of the mandatory update from old SHA1 signatures to SHA256, in order to keep using the platform securely. The old SHA1 signatures will stop working on November 23th, when Redsys virtual POS will accept only signatures generated using SHA-256.

Note that only simple payments by post-redirect method is implemented, not SOAP option is covered on this project.

**This code includes a sample web that implements the library. I recommend see this sample to a better understand of how to use the library.**

You can find an example here: http://redsystpv.azurewebsites.net.

## How to install

You can install RedsysTPV as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RedsysTPV.NetStandard): 

	PM> Install-Package RedsysTPV.NetStandard

## How to use

The payment platform works as follow:

1. The commerce post an html form with obfuscated data and an operation signature.
2. If request is correct, platform redirect user to the bank payment page.
3. User types his card number on a secure bank page
4. and the platform sends a background request to a specific commerce url to notify operation results.
5. User is redirected to a ok/ko page of the commerce.

### Create payment request

```csharp
var paymentRequestService = new PaymentRequestService();

var paymentRequest = 
	new PaymentRequest(
		Ds_Merchant_ConsumerLanguage: Language.Spanish,
		Ds_Merchant_MerchantCode: "012345678",	
		Ds_Merchant_Terminal: "1",	
		Ds_Merchant_TransactionType:  TransactionType.Authorization,
                Ds_Merchant_Amount: 123,
                Ds_Merchant_Currency: Currency.EUR,
		Ds_Merchant_Order: "9999TEST0001",
		Ds_Merchant_MerchantURL: "http://www.example.com/payment-notifications"),
		Ds_Merchant_UrlOK: "http://www.example.com/payment-ok",
		Ds_Merchant_UrlKO: "http://www.example.com/payment-ko");

//Case you need to set the redsys payment methods
paymentRequest.Ds_Merchant_PayMethod = PaymentMethod.CreditCard;
 
var formData = 
	paymentRequestService.GetPaymentRequestFormData(
		paymentRequest: paymentRequest,
		merchantKey: "put_here_your_commerce_hash_key");

ViewBag.ConnectionURL = "https://sis-t.redsys.es:25443/sis/realizarPago"; // for production environment, replace with https://sis.redsys.es/sis/realizarPago
```

This generates a model (formData) that contains the fields required to fill this html form (example for MVC View):

```HTML
@model RedsysTPV.Models.PaymentFormData
<form name="frm" action="@ViewBag.ConnectionURL" method="POST">
	<input type="hidden" name="Ds_SignatureVersion" value="@Model.Ds_SignatureVersion" />
	<input type="hidden" name="Ds_MerchantParameters" value="@Model.Ds_MerchantParameters" />
	<input type="hidden" name="Ds_Signature" value="@Model.Ds_Signature" />
	<input type="submit" value="Enviar" style="display: none;">
</form>
<script>
	document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```

The form will be send automatically by the tiny javascript, and the user will see the payment page of the gateway.

### Get payment response:

```csharp
var paymentResponseService = new PaymentResponseService();

var merchantParameters = Convert.ToString(Request["Ds_MerchantParameters"]);
var merchantKey = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["MerchantKey"];
var platformSignature = Convert.ToString(Request["Ds_Signature"]);

var processedPayment = paymentResponseService.GetProcessedPayment(merchantParameters, merchantKey, platformSignature);

if (processedPayment.IsValidSignature)
{
	// Signature is correct, the request come from trusted source
	if (processedPayment.IsPaymentPerformed.DefaultIfEmpty(false).Single())
	{
		// Payment accepted: success
		// Update the order on database, etc
	}
	else
	{
		// Payment rejected: fail
		// Update the order on database, etc
	}
}
else
{
	// Signature is not valid, the request come from untrusted source
}
```
